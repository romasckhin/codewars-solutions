We need prime numbers and we need them now!

Write a method that takes a maximum bound and returns all primes up to and including the maximum bound.

For example,

11 => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]





//function prime(num) {
    
  let s = []
  let p = []
  
  for ( let i = 2; i <= num; i++ ) {
    
    if (!s[i]) {
      p.push(i)
    }
    for ( let k = i * i; k <= num; k += i) {
      s[k] = true
    }
  }
  return p
}
