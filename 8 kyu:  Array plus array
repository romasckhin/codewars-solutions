I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.





//

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  const sum1 = arr1.reduce((acc,crr) => acc + crr)
  const sum2 = arr2.reduce((acc,crr) => acc + crr)
  return sum1 + sum2
}
